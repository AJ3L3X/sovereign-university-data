# Introduction: The Bitcoin Course

![Introduction](https://youtu.be/PdiL6_1wbQY)

Bitcoin is a significant innovation that goes beyond a simple currency. It is a technological and monetary revolution capable of transforming our perception of money and financial transactions. Bitcoin is also a decentralized currency, which means that it is not under the control of any entity or institution.
In this course, we will discuss the monetary aspects of Bitcoin, including how to buy and sell bitcoins, securely store them in digital wallets, and use them to make transactions.
We will also look at the role of miners, who are essential to creating new bitcoins and securing the Bitcoin network. Additionally, we will explore the future of Bitcoin and how Lightning Network technology can improve Bitcoin transactions.

It is essential to understand that Bitcoin is not only a currency but also a technology that can revolutionize our perception of money and financial transactions. Learning how to use Bitcoin is a fundamental skill, just as we have learned to use the Internet or drive a car.
It is important to remember that Bitcoin is a relatively new technology, and it is normal not to understand everything immediately. However, learning how to use Bitcoin is crucial because it can have a significant impact on our financial lives.

Before delving into the definition and functioning of money in society, we start with the genesis of Bitcoin. Then, we will explore the role of Bitcoin as a currency and how it can transform our perception of financial transactions.

## The Prehistory of Bitcoin

![The Prehistory of Bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljHLhTzrLsw)

To understand the origin of Bitcoin, we must go back to the 1980s and the cypherpunk movement. Cypherpunks were pioneers who innovated and experimented with technologies such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), the internet, and cryptography. They shaped a movement dedicated to privacy protection in the digital age.

In 2009, a person (or group of people) named Satoshi Nakamoto developed Bitcoin based on the technologies developed by cypherpunks. Bitcoin represents a revolution on several levels: digital, financial, and technological. To fully grasp the nature and scope of this revolution, it is crucial to understand the foundations of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin challenges the traditional financial system by highlighting the inequalities and inflation problems associated with fiat currency. Currencies issued by central banks and states, such as the euro or the dollar, are subject to inflation. This can have adverse effects on societies and individuals.

In contrast, Bitcoin, which is a synthesis of technologies developed since the 1970s, has a limited maximum quantity, giving it a characteristic similar to that of gold. The debate over the validity of Bitcoin as a currency continues, but one thing is certain: thanks to the legacy of cypherpunks, Bitcoin is here to stay.

Bitcoin is both a digital currency and a computer protocol. As such, it was designed to endure. It is important to recognize the essential role of contributors and supporters of this project, including those who donate via platforms like Patreon.

In summary, Bitcoin is a technological, financial, and social revolution that has its roots in the cypherpunk movement. It challenges the traditional financial system and offers a promising and sustainable alternative. To fully understand Bitcoin, it is essential to understand these key concepts and the legacy of those who contributed to its creation.

# What is money?

## Money throughout history

![Money](https://youtu.be/LslJVNCvHhA)

The evolution of money is a fascinating aspect of human history, reflecting the ingenuity of civilizations throughout the ages to meet constantly evolving economic needs. The earliest forms of money were tangible goods, often tangible consumer goods such as cereals or livestock. However, for about 4000 years, gold has become a universally recognized standard.
Gold meets the criteria of an effective currency: its natural rarity makes it valuable, while its divisibility and transportability make it practical for trade. Additionally, extracting gold from the earth requires a significant amount of energy, reinforcing its intrinsic value. However, with the advent of technology and the expansion of the global economy, gold has gradually been abandoned in favor of more practical solutions, such as bills and digital currencies.

The criteria for an effective currency are multiple. A good currency must be fungible, meaning interchangeable without loss of value; divisible, to facilitate transactions of different sizes; and liquid, meaning easily convertible into goods or services.

Historically, these criteria have been met by physical objects such as gold. However, with the development of financial infrastructure, gold has been transformed into banknotes, which are more practical for daily commerce.

Today, currencies are still evolving, adapting their forms to meet different functions. For example, while gold is an excellent store of value, it is no longer suitable for the current globalized economy. Similarly, fiat currencies such as the dollar and the euro are very liquid, but their value is eroded by inflation.

Bitcoin, as a digital currency, presents new possibilities. It offers an excellent store of value and is a good means of exchange, but is not yet widely used as a unit of account. Due to inflation, fiat currencies such as the euro and the dollar are not ideal as long-term stores of value.

Faced with the challenges posed by current monetary systems, alternatives are being sought to preserve and increase the value of money. Banking systems are turning to solutions such as digital transfers and microtransactions to meet the needs of the global economy and adapt to technological advances.

![Money](assets/posters/en/3._money.png)

## Fiat currencies

![Fiat currencies](https://youtu.be/1hOrDrmT27g)

Exploring the impacts of fiat currencies on the financial system is an essential aspect of our understanding of contemporary economic dynamics. To paraphrase George Santayana, "those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it." It is therefore with this historical approach that we approach the subject of fiat currencies.
These currencies rely on trust and the assurance that their value will be preserved. However, this trust is currently being shaken by rampant inflation and unprecedented debt. Fiat currencies ultimately depend on the faith we place in the institutions that regulate them, and this faith seems to be fading.

It is in this context that the Bitcoin revolution is gaining momentum. This trusted currency aims to separate the state from money, thus undermining the state's control over the financial system. The ability to print money has allowed for a gradual devaluation of it, eroding the purchasing power of the population. Since the introduction of the euro, purchasing power has decreased by 30%, while American purchasing power has lost 98% of its value since 1900. Fiat currencies no longer have solid support, as gold has been abandoned. Inflation acts as a surreptitious tax that erodes purchasing power. It allows a state to devalue its currency to repay its debt and finance its projects.

Money printing leads to inflation, gradually impoverishing the population. In contrast, financial institutions and wealthy individuals have benefited from this practice, creating a gap of inequality and promoting authoritarianism. States are forced to maintain their power by devaluing their currency to facilitate debt repayment. The current financial system is regulated and restricted to avoid collapse. A disruption of this system could risk causing a major economic crisis. Political actors lack the will to make radical changes, allowing the system to continue its course until a possible implosion.

In response to these systemic challenges, Bitcoin presents itself as a decentralized solution. Historically, gold has been favored as a currency due to its resistance to counterfeiting. Similarly, Bitcoin, by its decentralized nature, cannot be falsified and is limited to 21 million units. Bitcoin is a currency based on trust, transparency, and freedom, offering an attractive alternative to the current centralized monetary system.

At the same time, the emergence of central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs, seems inevitable. While these may offer centralized economic planning, they could also hinder financial freedom and potentially become authoritarian.

![Fiat currencies](assets/posters/en/4._fiat_currency.png)

## Hyperinflation

![Hyperinflation](https://youtu.be/cYKmgflsy_8)

Hyperinflation is a potentially devastating phenomenon in a fiat monetary system, caused by human decisions that can lead to the eradication of monetary value. As a result, accumulated economies can dissipate in a relatively short period of time. There are notable cases of hyperinflation throughout history, such as Germany in 1923, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, among others. Fiduciary currencies, which are created out of thin air, differ from common currencies like gold. For example, with an inflation rate of 2%, you lose 2% of your purchasing power annually. At 7%, you lose half in 10 years. At a rate of 20%, you lose practically everything in less than 3 years. Thus, hyperinflation can quickly eliminate accumulated economies.

This phenomenon of hyperinflation is not new and has persisted throughout history. To understand this dynamic, it is essential to examine the stages of hyperinflation and the process of losing confidence in the currency.

The centralization of monetary power facilitates currency creation and regulation. However, a loss of confidence in a currency can trigger hyperinflation. Individuals then begin to question the origin of money and the process of monetary creation. The first stage of hyperinflation is the loss of confidence, usually due to external factors such as wars, social measures, or the fall in prices of a key resource. The second stage is the collapse of the currency.
As governments lose control of trust, individuals begin to exchange their currency for a more stable one, such as the dollar. This leads to a rise in prices, creating a vicious circle where goods and services become increasingly expensive. To meet these needs, the state prints more money, leading to exponential inflation as the state tries to control prices. When the currency loses all trust, inflation becomes astronomical. A new currency is then introduced to replace the old one, such as the dollar. A notable example of hyperinflation is Germany in the years 1920-1923. To revive the economy, a new currency was created, backed by German, French, and English debt, and guaranteed by German land.

Resolving a hyperinflation crisis often requires radical changes, such as revolutions, changes of government, changes of central bankers, among others. Loss of trust, currency collapse, and reconstruction are essential phases for launching a new economy.

There are several other examples of hyperinflation throughout history, including Hungary, Zimbabwe, France in 1795, and Chile. Many anecdotes illustrate the devaluation of currency and the fluctuation of the value of common goods. For example, during the war, the French were able to buy German works of art at low prices with francs in Germany.

Knowing about hyperinflation and understanding how it occurs is one thing, but how can one protect oneself against it? To protect against hyperinflation, it is recommended to diversify one's portfolio by getting rid of weak currencies and investing in strong assets or currencies, such as gold or Bitcoin. Stocks of companies capable of quickly revaluing their prices, such as Apple or Microsoft, or real estate investment can also prove to be good investments.

There is much to learn about managing a financial portfolio. Fortunately, there are many training and resources available to acquire these skills. Moreover, not printing money at will is the best way to prevent hyperinflation. Bitcoin is a currency that has specific characteristics. Its ability to serve for global trade will be discussed in a future video.

In conclusion, hyperinflation rapidly degrades the value of a currency, leading to a loss of savings and a lack of confidence in the monetary system. As Voltaire once suggested, fiduciary currency will always lose its intrinsic value and eventually converge to zero. Currency based on trust, debt, and monetary printing is a defective currency that cannot guarantee purchasing power or preserve savings. Furthermore, politicians have an unlimited ability to print money, threatening individuals' savings.

## 21 million bitcoins

![21 million Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/Y92R4EWk5uo)

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency with a predetermined maximum quantity of 21 million units. This intrinsic feature of scarcity is determined by its computer protocol. Regarding its monetary emission, it can be illustrated by a curve that represents the quantity of bitcoins created and the frequency of their emission. For example, in 2022, approximately 18.5 million bitcoins were in circulation. Forecasts indicate that in 2025, there will be around 19.5 million bitcoins, and in 2037, this figure will reach 20.4 million.

The creation of new bitcoins is the result of the mining process, a procedure for validating and executing transactions on the Bitcoin network. Miners, who perform this task, are rewarded with the issuance of new bitcoins every ten minutes. This reward is programmed to halve every four years, an event known as "halving." This gives the monetary emission curve a stair-like shape. Due to this halving mechanism, it can be mathematically predicted that the creation of bitcoins will stop in 2140 when the total number of bitcoins reaches its limit of 21 million.

The scarcity of Bitcoin is guaranteed by two key mechanisms: the limit set at 21 million bitcoins and the computer protocol that cannot be changed without the consensus of the majority of the network. Two other crucial elements contribute to maintaining this limit: game theory and mining difficulty adjustment. Miners are incentivized to validate transactions and create new bitcoins every ten minutes. As the number of issued bitcoins approaches the 21 million limit, the network will be sustained by transaction fees and the remaining bitcoins not yet mined.

The mining difficulty adjustment is done every two weeks to ensure that, on average, a new block is added to the blockchain every ten minutes. This frequency of block creation and the total quantity of bitcoins are fixed aspects of the Bitcoin protocol and cannot be changed without general consensus, unlike arbitrary decisions made in traditional monetary systems.

The fixed quantity of bitcoins, initially set at 21 million, cannot be changed. Any modification of the Bitcoin protocol would require the agreement of the entire user community, which is highly unlikely. The idea of devaluing the currency goes against the fundamental philosophy of Bitcoin.
The scarcity of Bitcoin is a major asset, as there will always be a maximum of 21 million units. The amount of bitcoins in circulation is public and verifiable by anyone. In fact, anyone can verify the amount of bitcoins in circulation by entering a simple command on a Bitcoin node. This transparency and verifiability strengthen trust in the Bitcoin system, which does not rely on centralized institutions or individuals, but on a mathematical guarantee inherent in its protocol. The concept of sound monetary management is intrinsic to Bitcoin, as it is impossible to create more bitcoins than the predetermined limit or to destroy users' savings. This is a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes Bitcoin from other forms of currency.

Furthermore, according to the principles of Austrian economics, Bitcoin is considered an excellent form of currency. Indeed, its quantity is strictly controlled and issued predictably, which corresponds to the Austrian ideal of monetary creation. Unlike traditional currencies, which can be subject to inflation due to excessive monetary printing, Bitcoin maintains its value thanks to its programmed scarcity.

In summary, Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, programmed scarcity, and transparency, offers a unique alternative to traditional monetary systems. It illustrates how technology can be used to create a currency that is not only useful and verifiable, but also preserves the value of users' savings by strictly limiting its supply.

![21 million bitcoins](assets/posters/en/6._21_millions.png)

## Money: a social tool

![conclusion on money](https://youtu.be/xJsT7Jk5xWE)

Money is a social tool that must adapt to needs and technology. Over time, gold has been used as a store of value because it was rare and could not be devalued. However, later on, gold was replaced by debt and fiat currency, which is easy to copy and creates inflation.

Bitcoin is a realistic monetary alternative because it is rare and limited to 21 million bitcoins that cannot be changed. Monetary creation is maintained through the adjustment of difficulty every 2 weeks, ensuring verifiable mathematical proof of its scarcity. Unlike euros and dollars in circulation that frequently change at the whim of political decision-makers, Bitcoin is a mathematical currency with a fixed monetary policy. It is therefore an excellent store of value because it cannot be changed. Furthermore, Bitcoin is a non-human and non-emotional currency that executes blindly.

In conclusion, Bitcoin is offers a philosophical and economic challenge to financial institutions. It is important to understand its fundamental basics to engage in a constructive intellectual debate on the future of currency.

# Bitcoin Wallets

## What are Bitcoin wallets?

![Understanding Bitcoin wallets](https://youtu.be/GsnX7qdODK8)

Here, we will explore the storage and security of Bitcoins in wallets.

Firstly, what is a Bitcoin wallet? A wallet is a place where the private keys that give access to your Bitcoins are stored. A wallet can be software on your computer, an application on your smartphone, a hardware device like a USB key, or even a piece of paper.

Each wallet contains a pair of keys: a public key, which is like a postal address, and a private key, which is like the key to your mailbox. The public key is the address you give to people to send you Bitcoins, and the private key is what allows you to spend the Bitcoins received at that address.

The cost of a Bitcoin wallet can vary depending on your specific needs and the amount you want to secure. There are different types of wallets suitable for different uses, whether you are a small or large business, or an individual.

Although your keys are stored in your wallet, the Bitcoins themselves are actually stored in the Bitcoin blockchain, which is a public distributed ledger in the cloud. That's why losing your wallet doesn't necessarily mean losing your Bitcoins, as long as you have backed up your private key elsewhere.

Bitcoins are not actually "stored" in your wallet, but rather in the Bitcoin blockchain in the cloud. To access your Bitcoins, you need your private key, which is usually a list of 24 words known as a "recovery phrase" or "recovery seed". The probability of guessing this phrase is extremely low, thanks to the power of cryptography.
If someone were able to crack Bitcoin's cryptography, they would be able to crack just about anything. Fortunately, Bitcoin security can be strengthened if necessary. In fact, the probability of correctly guessing your recovery phrase is about the same as finding a specific grain of sand among all the sand on Earth.

The probability of a hack on your Bitcoin wallet is astronomically low if you follow good security practices. That's why it's important to follow the advice of cryptography experts to secure your account.

Choose a wallet that fits your needs and use case. Detailed tutorials on using and securing different wallets are available on many Bitcoin-dedicated websites, as well as in various practical Bitcoin training courses.

![Explanation of Bitcoin Wallets](assets/posters/en/8._what_is_a_bitcoin_wallet.png)

## Choosing your security

![Choosing your security](https://youtu.be/qhjEJuJHRf8)

When you hold Bitcoins, the security of your funds is a major concern. The first question to ask is who owns these funds. Is it a company or an individual? The necessary security measures will vary depending on this.

Another important factor to consider is the amount of money you need to secure and the intended use. Is it a sum you will use regularly or is it a long-term investment? It is crucial to adapt security measures to each situation, as there is no universal solution.

There are several types of wallets to secure your Bitcoins, and the choice will depend on the desired level of security. Security standards vary depending on the levels.

At level 1, we have the private key, which unlocks access to your funds. It is a list of 24 words, and only one signature is required to make a transaction. Different types of wallets include hardware wallets, mobile applications, and desktop software. However, the value of money is subjective, so it is crucial to adapt security to each user's comfort level.

At level 2, in addition to the private key, a password phrase is required. Level 3 is multi-signature security (Multi-sig), which requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. The latter is ideal for businesses.

Risks associated with wallets include key loss, theft, and hacking. Multi-signature security helps to limit these risks and ensure fund security.
The "custodial" model is a traditional system where you entrust your Bitcoins to a trusted third party to secure your savings. The problem with this system is that you lose the benefits of the financial sovereignty that Bitcoin offers, such as direct ownership of your savings and independence from banks. Risks of the custodial model include entrusting your money to someone else and the risk that this platform may be hacked or go bankrupt. Human errors are often the cause of hacks, not the software used.

Using a cold wallet, which is not connected to the internet, is recommended to avoid hacks. By using custodial services, we risk recreating the traditional financial system where banks control everyone's savings and can afford to create more money than they actually hold.

In conclusion, direct ownership of one's Bitcoins is essential to ensure financial sovereignty and prepare for any potential instability in the current financial system. It is recommended to use a mobile wallet for daily expenses and a physical offline, or "cold," wallet to store larger amounts. Companies, on the other hand, should consider using multi-signature systems for increased security.

It is essential to avoid custodial services as much as possible, which can reproduce some of the vulnerabilities of the traditional financial system. Practical steps for creating and managing a Bitcoin wallet will be covered in our next session.

![Choosing Your Security](assets/posters/en/9._choose_the_right_wallet.png)

## Setting up a wallet

![setting up a wallet](https://youtu.be/2MRRERHm7ZM)

The security of your Bitcoins is crucial, and a simple mistake can have costly consequences. That's why we will progress step by step and guide you with industry best practices. Your private key, often represented by a list of 24 words (or "seed"), is the key to your funds. If this key is revealed to a third party, consider the associated funds no longer secure. Therefore, when initializing your wallet, it is important to follow these rules:

- Hide all cameras.
- Do not take a photo of the list of words.
- Do not enter it on a computer or phone.
- Do not save it as a contact or self-send it via SMS.

You will literally take a blank sheet of paper or print out this template, and write with a pen, neatly and clearly, the list of words in order. If the ink fades over time, you may lose your funds, so there are alternative solutions to traditional ink. If you write poorly, your heirs may not be able to read it and therefore not recover the funds. Once the words are written, it is crucial to make a handwritten copy. This allows for a backup in case of loss or accident.

Once the copies are made, store the lists of words in folders, in a safe place where you will remember to look for them! Do not create a too complex hiding plan where you risk losing them. Your words = your money. "Cold" wallets generally have these word lists, as do "on-chain" mobile wallets. Mobile Lightning Network (LN) wallets may have different systems. Only bad wallets that we strongly advise against will not give you a list of 24 words, but may ask for an account, email address, or worse, an ID. The absence of a list of 24 words should alert you.

![setting up a wallet](assets/posters/en/10._set_up_your_wallet.png)

## Standing the test of time

![standing the test of time](https://youtu.be/p8eZPt_XnwI)

Security is a major concern in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Indeed, like any form of wealth, your bitcoins must be protected against loss, theft, and degradation, especially in the long term. Securing your bitcoins requires some technical knowledge and awareness of associated risks, which leads us to discuss two main strategies: engraving your bitcoins in steel and creating an inheritance plan.

One method for securing your bitcoins in the long term is to engrave your recovery keys (for example, a 24-word phrase known as a seed phrase) in a resistant material such as steel. This creates a physical backup of your keys that is resistant to both physical deterioration and fire.

In addition to this, creating an inheritance plan is also a crucial step in ensuring that your digital assets will be properly managed after your death. This plan may include a handwritten letter detailing your assets and identifying trusted individuals to contact. It is also crucial to discuss the acquisition of bitcoins with a notary to ensure tax compliance, although it is important to never directly entrust your bitcoins to a third party, including a notary.
The security of your bitcoins in the long term is not limited to creating physical backups or developing an inheritance plan. Privacy is another important consideration. For example, it is preferable to buy bitcoins without providing identification in order to minimize the risk of identity theft.

In addition, using Bitcoin wallets that meet your needs is essential to ensure both your anonymity and the security of your assets. Security tools such as smart cards, hardware wallets, and OpenDime devices can all contribute to strengthening the security of your bitcoins. It is also important to memorize your recovery phrase (or "seed phrase"), a practice known as a "brain wallet", which ensures that you always have access to your bitcoins, even in the event of loss or theft of your hardware wallet.

In summary, security and privacy are two key aspects of owning bitcoins in the long term. In the next section, we will discuss the technical workings of Bitcoin in detail. We hope this information will help you navigate the Bitcoin ecosystem safely.

![passing the test of time](assets/posters/en/19._think_long_term.png)

## Summary on Bitcoin Wallet Security

![Chapter 2 Conclusion](https://youtu.be/U28-oh950Dw)

Bitcoin wallets are software that allow you to store and manage bitcoins. There are several types:

- Mobile wallets: these applications are available on your smartphone and are convenient for small amounts. However, they are less secure than other wallets.
- Computer wallets: these software programs are installed on your computer and are more secure than mobile wallets. However, they can be vulnerable to viruses and hacker attacks.
- USB keys: these wallets are more secure than computer wallets because they are not constantly connected to the internet.

To initialize a wallet, you must write a list of 24 or 12 words on a piece of paper without a camera. The private key represents your right to sign and send bitcoins.

To ensure the security of your Bitcoin wallet, it is important to follow certain rules.

- Create an inheritance plan: to ensure that your loved ones can retrieve the money in case of a problem, you must create an inheritance plan and engrave your private key in steel.
- Avoid exchange platforms: it is best to avoid leaving your bitcoins on exchange platforms, as they can be subject to hacker attacks. It is preferable to use receiving addresses to receive and send bitcoins.
- Use cold wallets: your security level evolves in three steps: mobile wallet, cold wallet (hardware wallet), and multisignature system. Cold wallets are physical devices that store your Bitcoins and are safer than mobile or computer wallets.

# Technical Aspects of Bitcoin

## Launch of Bitcoin

![Launch of Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/GdeLB39QdUQ)

October 31, 2008 marks the birth of a new financial technology: Bitcoin. It was on this date that Satoshi Nakamoto, the anonymous architect of Bitcoin, presented his innovation to the world through a letter distributed to the cypherpunk mailing list, a community of cryptographers passionate about privacy and encryption.
This letter contained a document, called the "White Paper", describing the functioning, use, and defense system of Bitcoin. This initiative did not immediately generate enthusiasm, given the previous failures of digital cash systems. Nevertheless, this White Paper eventually became a reference for Bitcoin users and the subject of many debates in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

On January 3, 2009 at 6:15 p.m., Satoshi officially inaugurated the Bitcoin network by creating the first block, also called the genesis block, which marked the launch of the Bitcoin blockchain. This block contains a revealing message of Bitcoin's mission: "03/jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".
On January 8, 2009, Satoshi announced the publication of Bitcoin-0.1.0. Quickly, Hal Finney took hold of the software and joined the network. There were now 2 miners and 2 nodes in the network. Finney immortalized this step by tweeting "Running Bitcoin". On January 12, 2009, the first Bitcoin transaction was made between Satoshi and Hal Finney. This transaction, of 10 BTC, was recorded in block 170.

Interest in Bitcoin grew rapidly, and many people began testing, debating, bug fixing, mining, and reflecting on the ethical, economic, and philosophical aspects of Bitcoin. To facilitate these exchanges, the BitcoinTalk forum was created on November 22, 2009 by Satoshi.
This forum quickly became the preferred discussion venue for Bitcoin users. This is where many memes and symbols associated with Bitcoin were born, such as the Bitcoin logo, Hodl, magic internet money, and Pizza day.
On May 21, 2010, Laszlo Hanyecz made history with Bitcoin by offering to buy 2 pizzas for 10,000 BTC. This was the first time Bitcoin was used to buy tangible goods. Laszlo is also recognized for revolutionizing Bitcoin mining through GPU mining.
In 2010, as Bitcoin began to attract media attention, Satoshi decided to distance himself. On December 12, 2010, he published his last post on the forum, announcing his departure. On April 23, 2011, he made his last known private exchange by email. Satoshi then disappeared, leaving his creation in the hands of the community. Despite Satoshi's absence, Bitcoin continues to develop. Every 10 minutes, the history of Bitcoin is written, and the protocol continues to function as intended. Regardless of fear, uncertainty, or doubt (FOMO or FUD), Bitcoin continues to move forward, with a 99.98% availability.

Bitcoin is perceived differently by each individual. For some, it is a fungal entity like mycelium, for others, it is a black hole, a virus, or even a religion. Whether one loves or hates Bitcoin, it continues to exist, with its constant rhythm of 10 minutes per 10 minutes, like the heartbeat of a new financial system.

To deepen your knowledge of Satoshi Nakamoto's writings, I recommend Phil Champagne's book. Satoshi himself mentioned, "Governments are good at cutting off the heads of centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." Bitcoin is an unprecedented innovation in the financial world. Despite challenges and controversies, it continues to be a driving force in the world of digital currency.

![Launch of Bitcoin](assets/posters/en/7._lancement_bitcoin.png)

## Explanation of a transaction

![Explanation of a transaction](https://youtu.be/GJlUqtGzxLk)

A Bitcoin transaction involves an exchange of Bitcoins between two parties. Let's take two protagonists, Alice and Bob. Alice wants to acquire Bitcoins, while Bob already holds them.

For Bob to transfer Bitcoins to Alice, she must provide Bob with her Bitcoin address, which essentially serves as the receiving destination for the Bitcoins. This address, derived from Alice's public key, is unique to her Bitcoin wallet.

Next, Bob initiates the transaction using Alice's receiving address. He also adds transaction fees, which are an incentive for miners to include the transaction in the next block. These fees are essential to prevent the network from being flooded with worthless transactions.

The size of the transaction depends on the number of parties involved and the complexity of the transaction. To finalize the transaction, Bob must digitally sign it with his private key, which verifies that he is the rightful owner of the Bitcoins he wishes to transfer.
Miners have the role of taking unconfirmed transactions, verifying them, and compiling them into a block. To do this, they must solve a cryptographic puzzle in a process called "proof of work." This is a computationally intensive process that requires considerable processing power. This proof of work requires finding a solution to a difficult mathematical equation, a process that can require billions of attempts. After finding a solution, miners can add the block to the blockchain and are rewarded for their work with newly created Bitcoins and transaction fees.

After validation by miners, the block is added to the blockchain, which is an immutable public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions. Each block is added to the blockchain approximately every ten minutes.

It is essential to note that modifying the blockchain's history would require computing power greater than 51% of the entire Bitcoin mining network, which is practically impossible. However, if a malicious miner succeeded in inserting a fraudulent transaction into their block and solving the proof of work, the block would be added to the blockchain. However, it would be rejected by other network nodes that validate transactions by referring to the network's consensus rule.

Ultimately, the Bitcoin transaction system is decentralized and operates peer-to-peer, without a trusted intermediary. Users transmit money by digitally signing transactions with their private keys. Miners do not hold all the power, as users also have significant control via nodes.

To completely destroy the Bitcoin network, all miners, nodes, and users would need to be eliminated - a task that is practically impossible due to the decentralized nature of the network.

![Explanation of a transaction](assets/posters/en/11._explaination_of_a_transaction.png)

## Bitcoin Nodes

![https://youtu.be/3vQmDJ4_ooM](https://youtu.be/3vQmDJ4_ooM)

Nodes are a fundamental element of the Bitcoin network architecture. They perform various crucial functions, including maintaining the blockchain, participating in network decentralization, guiding the system, and validating transactions.

The Bitcoin network is made up of all connected nodes. Each node holds a copy of the blockchain, allowing them to verify transactions and prevent any attempt at fraud. The decentralized aspect of the network gives Bitcoin exceptional resilience and robustness - to destroy it, all nodes worldwide would need to be eliminated.
Nodes fulfill three main missions: preserving the history of the blockchain, transmitting information, and verifying the accuracy of broadcasted transactions. They follow the Bitcoin consensus rules to validate transactions and blocks, which are simple and unchanging. Additionally, nodes oversee Bitcoin's monetary consensus rules to ensure that miners adhere to mining guidelines.

Nodes act as the legal system of the network, ensuring that all participants follow the same rules. To make changes to the network, approval from all nodes is necessary. If a majority approves a change, all nodes are updated with the new rules. Major changes are rare and require significant coordination among thousands of actors with varying ideologies.

Once the importance of nodes in the Bitcoin network is understood, it is necessary to examine their cost and hosting options. The cost of a node depends on the type of node but can be around 200-300 euros for a physical node.

Expenses necessary to operate a Bitcoin node include a 20-gigabyte internet connection per month, which costs an average of 150-200 euros, and about 5 euros per year for electricity. It is possible to acquire specific boxes to host the hardware necessary for managing a Bitcoin node.

There are two options for hosting a node: at home or via a hosting server, the latter costing an average of 12 euros per month. The importance of nodes in the decentralization of the Bitcoin network is crucial to understand. Dedicated MRL node training exists for those who wish to deepen their understanding.

The affordable cost and accessibility of a Bitcoin node, compared to other cryptocurrencies that require more expensive infrastructure, are a significant advantage.

One of the fundamental principles of Bitcoin is the use of nodes to validate transactions and disseminate information throughout the network. This structure guarantees the decentralization of the system and the financial independence of users. This approach contrasts with other cryptocurrencies that do not offer everyone the opportunity to own nodes, thus limiting their decentralization and resilience.
A key aspect of Bitcoin's operation is the limited size of its blocks. This restriction limits the number of transactions that can be processed in a given time. If block size were increased, it could lead to network centralization and raise barriers to entry for new participants. Additionally, if nodes remain beyond the reach of external interventions, Bitcoin can effectively resist any form of censorship.

The year 2017 was marked by intense controversy, known as the "blockchain war." This conflict pitted actors who wanted to modify Bitcoin by increasing block size to increase transaction capacity against those who sought to preserve user independence and power. Ultimately, users and nodes triumphed by rejecting the proposed change initiated by miners, exchange platforms, and institutions.

Following this victory, nodes activated the SegWit protocol, allowing for future improvements and paving the way for the implementation of the Lightning Network. This situation demonstrates that users, through their nodes, hold real power within Bitcoin, enabling them to face off against large institutions. The real losers of this war were Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, which lost 80% and 90% of their monetary value compared to Bitcoin, and are relatively underused.

In summary, nodes, whether embodied by physical devices or online software, play a central role in the Bitcoin ecosystem. They maintain the blockchain history, validate transactions, disseminate information, maintain network consensus, vote on future improvements, and ensure system decentralization.

## Miners

![Bitcoin miners](https://youtu.be/Lr5L3uy244w)

Bitcoin miners are individuals or entities who dedicate electricity and time to solving complex mathematical equations to secure the Bitcoin network. They play a crucial role in validating transactions, making them legitimate in the eyes of all network users. Miners use ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) machines to solve the SHA256 hashing algorithm and validate a block of transactions. This algorithm is designed in such a way that it is easy to verify a solution, but extremely difficult to find one. Miners must try hundreds of billions of combinations before finding the right solution. The difficulty of this task increases with time and the number of participating miners.
The difficulty adjustment occurs every 2016 blocks to maintain an average interval of ten minutes between the creation of each block. When new miners join the network, the total hash rate increases, which reduces the average time needed to find a block. However, after about two weeks, the algorithm's difficulty is increased to bring the average block discovery time back to ten minutes.

The miners' economic model is based on the rewards they receive for their work. To maximize their chances of success, miners often collaborate in groups called "mining pools," where they combine their computing resources.

Miners gather transactions into candidate blocks and seek to solve the complex mathematical equation that will validate the block. In the event of a blockchain split (fork), two competing chains coexist until a new block is added to one of them, thereby determining the main chain.

Bitcoin innovated by proposing a solution to the double-spending problem through the use of the blockchain. In the digital world, the notion of ownership differs from that of the physical world. On the internet, everything can be copied and pasted, which poses problems in terms of double-spending for valuable digital assets.

Trust intermediaries, such as banks, were created to solve this technological problem and ensure that when an asset is transferred, it no longer belongs to the issuer. The problem of the Byzantine generals, a problem of coordinating information in a decentralized system without a trusted intermediary, then arises.

Proof of work and the blockchain are the solutions provided by Bitcoin to solve this problem. Bitcoin's "generals," or miners, verify financial transactions via the blockchain to ensure the authenticity of the information. The energy expenditure ensures the reliability of the information.

Miners are the guardians of the security of the Bitcoin network. They spend energy to solve complex mathematical equations. In the event of cheating, they would lose money, and their investment would be useless, which dissuades them from behaving dishonestly.

Even in the case of a 51% attack, the network remains secure because the attacker must spend as much energy as all the miners combined to attempt to modify the blockchain. It is thanks to this proof-of-work mechanism, which requires energy to be accomplished, that the network is secure.

Game theory applied to Bitcoin eliminates dishonest miners. Miners use ASIC machines to mine and receive a reward in case of success. Moreover, they often group together in mining pools to share their computing power and obtain rewards more quickly.

Bitcoin mining is a complex but essential process for the functioning and security of the Bitcoin network. Proof of work and the blockchain solve the problem of double spending and ensure the accuracy of information. Energy expenditure is necessary to validate the work done and ensure network security. Game theory applied to Bitcoin helps prevent dishonest behavior and maintain the security of the Bitcoin network.

## Bitcoin and Ecology

![Bitcoin & Ecology](https://youtu.be/nV2b2xAMfmU)

As a revolutionary invention, Bitcoin has given individuals living under financial oppression or a dictatorial regime a means to fight for their freedom. As a last resort, Bitcoin offers a form of financial freedom by escaping censorship and banking restrictions. Bitcoin is more than just a currency. It is a form of communication and expression of freedom. The energy spent by miners contributes to the defense of our freedom. Bitcoin allows for the emancipation from the current financial system, dominated by debt and excessive monetary creation by central banks.

For those living in countries with high inflation, Bitcoin is a matter of survival. It provides a means to survive in precarious financial situations. Additionally, Bitcoin offers a fairer and more equitable financial system. It also provides an opportunity for billions of people around the world to access the financial system.

Bitcoin miners are specialized computers that solve mathematical puzzles to secure the network and validate transactions. They are rewarded for their work by the creation of new blocks and the transactions contained within.

ASIC machines, specifically designed for mining Bitcoin, are commonly used. Unlike graphics cards used to mine other cryptocurrencies, ASICs are more efficient and have a longer lifespan. However, their use has raised environmental concerns.

Miners are mobile and can move based on laws and taxes. Electricity accounts for 90 to 95% of miners' operating costs, making the source, cost, and sustainability of electricity particularly important.

The risk of a 51% attack is low, as it is unlikely that a single actor can maintain this majority long enough to cause significant damage. When bitcoin production stops, transaction fees will increase on the main blockchain. However, microtransactions and daily transactions will continue to be processed on secondary layers, such as the Lightning Network.
The debate on the ecological impact of Bitcoin is often misguided, mainly due to an insufficient understanding of its usefulness and operation. Bitcoin cannot be evaluated simply in terms of energy cost per transaction, as miners secure both the current and historical network, transactions are grouped and not all are equivalent, and the impact of the Lightning Network is not taken into account. Those who claim that Bitcoin consumes too much energy may have political motivations or seek to sell their own blockchain solution. The ecological pretext is used to justify the banning of Bitcoin.

Ultimately, it is essential to discuss the economic and environmental issues of Bitcoin adoption. The current financial system, by encouraging overconsumption and indebtedness, poses serious problems. Easy access to credit, monetary issuance by banks, and the use of fractional reserve are all factors that promote overindebtedness. It is necessary to reform the monetary system to make money and resources scarcer. This will encourage more responsible consumption and a long-term vision. Inflation, by encouraging consumption and investment, has a negative impact on the environment.

The current Keynesian economy, unlike the Austrian economy, does not take into account the temporal aspect. Unlimited money cannot coexist with the limited resources of our planet. Politicians, due to their short-term vision and their need for economic growth to be re-elected, are not able to solve long-term environmental problems. Adopting a healthy currency like Bitcoin could empower the people economically.

The flames in oil wells, which burn methane to avoid pollution, can be extinguished by Bitcoin miners, which is beneficial for the environment. Bitcoin promotes the use of green energy. Methane can be converted into electricity to power mining machines, which is advantageous for everyone. The end of the petrodollar is necessary to end wars and overconsumption. The banking system, based on the petrodollar, promotes war. By removing the petrodollar, we can end wars and excessive monetary issuance.

The gold industry, with its polluting machines, has a greater environmental impact than the Bitcoin industry. Bitcoin technology is often misunderstood, and criticisms of its ecological impact are often simplistic. These criticisms may be motivated by political interests.
'Bitcoin has the potential to help with the ecological transition and contribute to a greener world. The media often spreads false ideas about Bitcoin and ecology. Without Bitcoin, it would be more difficult to finance the ecological transition through monetary creation.

## Summary of the technical aspects of Bitcoin

![chapter 3 conclusion](https://youtu.be/gqILoXTUKdc)

Satoshi Nakamoto launched the Bitcoin protocol in January 2009, which has evolved thanks to miners, nodes, and improvements. The community keeps Bitcoin anonymous and thanks to the use of nodes, which control the network. Miners use ASIC machines and electricity to validate blocks in the blockchain.

However, the ecological debate is tense, some defend Bitcoin as a more efficient alternative financial system for people without a bank account, while others criticize its environmental impact. Arguments against Bitcoin polluting are often unfounded. Research before debating to avoid saying nonsense.

The Bitcoin transaction process is decentralized, uncensorable, and unstoppable. Bitcoin has no leader and cannot be stopped. It is possible to regulate exchanges to limit Bitcoin, but this is limited in functionality. No judge or state can censor or stop Bitcoin.

# The circular economy of Bitcoin

## Bitcoin never sleeps!

![Bitcoin never sleeps](https://youtu.be/7535MAeHzxM)

The price of Bitcoin, like any other cryptocurrency, is characterized by significant volatility. Its value can fluctuate considerably depending on market variations. However, compared to fiat currencies, Bitcoin tends to see its value increase in the long term. Healthy savings can also include Bitcoin. One of the recommended strategies is dollar cost averaging, which involves regularly investing a fixed amount in Bitcoin, regardless of its current price. This allows smoothing the impact of price fluctuations in the long term. In addition, the "hodl" strategy (a term derived from a typo that has become popular in the crypto community, meaning "hold on for dear life") encourages holding onto Bitcoins rather than exchanging or selling them. In the long term, these strategies can be less risky and generate higher returns thanks to the effect of compound interest.

Bitcoin, with its limited quantity and halving process, follows a general upward trend. Like other financial assets, Bitcoin is subject to classic economic cycles that include periods of euphoria, speculative bubbles and corrections. This phenomenon is quite common in emerging technologies, where the market is not always rational or efficient.

Bitcoin's development and evolution are largely linked to the various groups of players who have gradually become part of its ecosystem. Bitcoin's first users were mainly technophiles, libertarians and gold enthusiasts. These groups were attracted to Bitcoin by its ability to solve problems such as financial deregulation and censorship. Later, Bitcoin's use spread to illicit trading sites on the dark web, such as Silk Road, due to its uncontrollable and pseudo-anonymous nature.

The second wave of adoption was largely stimulated by the use of Bitcoin on Silk Road, a black market on the dark web. This site drew attention to the uncontrollable and pseudo-anonymous nature of Bitcoin, prompting some criminal actors to use it. However, it should be noted that the use made of a tool, and not the tool itself, determines its legality or illegality.

It's worth noting that the illegal use of Bitcoin doesn't make a person a criminal per se. It is the use, not the tool, that can be classified as illegal. For example, the use of Bitcoin for activities such as prostitution is legal or illegal depending on each country's regulations on this activity.

2017 saw a major speculative bubble in the crypto-currency world, with thousands of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) launched. However, many of these new crypto-currencies had no concrete development or utility, and therefore quickly disappeared.

The crypto-currency market experienced a bubble in 2017, followed by a crash in 2018-2019. Currently, the market is going through another speculative bubble, which has taken the price of Bitcoin to 60,000. This bubble is distinguished from previous ones by a greater diversification of investors, including financial institutions and large corporations.
The Bitcoin market is unique in that it operates globally, 24/7, making regulation difficult for financial authorities. Unlike traditional currencies, such as the euro, which can lose value, Bitcoin has shown an upward trend due to its increasing rarity. However, the cryptocurrency industry is not without risks, especially for beginners. Scams and hacks are common. Additionally, there are many emerging concepts and trends to understand, such as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which have been around since 2015 but have recently gained popularity, the Metaverse, a virtual universe, and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), which is currently perceived as speculative. Understanding and enthusiasm for the crypto market is important.

In summary, it is important to note that Bitcoin is characterized by inherent volatility. Therefore, it is generally recommended to opt for a long-term investment strategy rather than engaging in short-term trading activities. Although the price of Bitcoin may undergo significant fluctuations, it tends to increase on average over a five-year period.

We encourage a thoughtful savings approach that includes an allocation in Bitcoin, adjusted according to your risk tolerance and financial goals. For those interested in acquiring Bitcoin, various methods exist, including direct purchase or acquisition through professional activities.

The world of Bitcoin is rich and constantly evolving, offering many opportunities for learning and development. It is recommended to continue your education and stay informed of the latest trends and developments in this field.

It is important to note that this warning is not financial advice. Bitcoin, like any other investment, carries risks. Do not spend more money than you can afford to lose. Always exercise due diligence and consult a qualified financial advisor before making any investment.

Past performance does not guarantee future performance. The information provided here is for educational purposes only. Any investment or trading strategy should be based on your own research and judgment.

## Obtaining bitcoins by working

![obtaining bitcoins by working](https://youtu.be/sHkadVRUQF8)

Bitcoin can be perceived as a parallel economy to traditional currencies. This means that it is possible to sell goods or services and be paid in Bitcoin. Transactions can be made directly in Bitcoin, without the need to go through an exchange platform. There are several methods for accepting Bitcoin as a means of payment, and these deserve to be studied. However, it should be noted that the use of Bitcoin is taxed in France, which may discourage some people from using it as a means of payment.

Despite this, it is important to emphasize that the Bitcoin economy exists and is developing in certain regions of the world, such as El Salvador. In addition, some individuals, businesses, and organizations already accept Bitcoin as a means of payment for their products or services.

To obtain bitcoins, you can buy them on platforms regulated by organizations such as the AMF (Autorité des Marchés Financiers) in France. This method involves certain risks and the traceability of your transactions. Another method for obtaining bitcoins is to accept this cryptocurrency as a means of payment for the products or services you offer. This method allows you to acquire bitcoins through your work without constantly worrying about the price of Bitcoin. However, this can be difficult as many people are reluctant to spend their bitcoins.

Furthermore, to facilitate the use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions, an open-source and collaborative project has been launched: BTCMap. This project lists all merchants who accept Bitcoin as well as the different Bitcoin communities around the world. You can visit their website at https://btcmap.org/ to discover the Bitcoin ecosystem around you. Thus, despite the difficulties and reluctance, there are initiatives like BTCMap that contribute to making the Bitcoin economy more accessible and practical for everyone.

Accepting Bitcoin as a merchant has several advantages, including no censorship, reduced transaction fees, increased efficiency, protection against inflation, as well as financial freedom and sovereignty. In addition, commercial activity and the circular economy of Bitcoin can contribute to the Bitcoin network while allowing for the acquisition of bitcoins. To accept Bitcoin, it is necessary to study the different available solutions and choose the one that best suits your business. Several factors must be taken into account, such as the expected transaction volume, the allocated budget, the type of commerce (online or physical), among others.

There are three levels of Bitcoin acceptance: static QR code, dedicated invoice wallet, and the use of the Lightning network. The static QR code allows for receiving Bitcoin payments simply by scanning a code, while the Lightning network allows for almost instantaneous transactions with extremely low fees.
Several tools can be used to facilitate the acceptance of Bitcoin, such as the Blue Wallet for beginners, or more advanced payment processors such as BTP Server, OpenNode, and Galois Bitcoin Beach Wallet for industrial use. Each solution has its advantages and disadvantages, particularly in terms of anonymity and fees.

In summary, using Bitcoin can offer many advantages, such as eliminating transaction fees, reducing credit card fraud, obtaining untraceable Bitcoins, as well as greater autonomy and flexibility. Accepting Bitcoin is a practice that is becoming more common in France, allowing not only to save on usual transaction fees but also to attract a forward-thinking clientele.

## Saving with Bitcoin

![Saving in Bitcoin](https://youtu.be/Ir5zzYc95IQ)

Bitcoin has become an important financial asset, mainly due to its limited supply and increasing demand. However, buying Bitcoin carries risks that require special attention. It is therefore recommended to consult an investment advisor before investing.

There are several ways to acquire Bitcoins, each with its own regulations. Some platforms require identification for verification, while others do not. It is crucial to understand the mechanisms of Bitcoin and digital wallets, as well as the regulations associated with each platform.

A common method of accumulating Bitcoins is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), which involves regularly investing small amounts. Several platforms offer this service, such as Stacking Sat, Relay, and PEMIUM. DCA can help smooth out short-term price fluctuations and is therefore considered a viable investment strategy for most individuals.

For large-scale investments, regulated and recognized platforms such as Kraken, Bitstamp, and Paymium are recommended. These platforms offer a safe and secure environment for large volume transactions.

Withdrawal and Use of Bitcoins, Legal Aspects, and Hypothetical Future
After purchase, it is recommended to immediately withdraw Bitcoins from exchange platforms to minimize the risks of hacking and fund blocking. Withdrawal fees can be high, sometimes up to 25 euros depending on the platform, so it is recommended to proceed in stages to ensure transaction security.
The use of regulated platforms is essential to avoid accusations of money laundering, terrorism financing, or tax evasion. It is important to note that, although the KYC (Know Your Customer) system is often criticized, it plays a crucial role in preventing these illicit activities. Bitcoin transactions are traceable, which can potentially harm users' privacy. A green and red address system, made possible by KYC, could theoretically hinder Bitcoin, but it is unlikely to happen due to Bitcoin's decentralized and peer-to-peer nature.

Bitcoin can be purchased through Bitcoin ATMs, although they are rare in France. The number of these ATMs is constantly increasing worldwide. There are various options for buying and selling Bitcoins, including direct transactions between individuals, online exchange platforms, and Bitcoin ATMs. It should be noted that there is usually a premium for non-KYC transactions.

It is also important to note that there are taxes to be paid on the resale of Bitcoins, approximately 30% in France. There is a legal section on the website with lawyers for more information.

![Saving with Bitcoin](assets/posters/en/16._saving_in_bitcoin.png)

## Hyper-Bitcoinization

![Hyper-Bitcoinization](https://youtu.be/lLxndxrzXR0)

Like any new technology, the adoption of Bitcoin follows a very classic distribution curve. We have surpassed the era of early adopters, and the indicators seem to point towards a complete democratization of Bitcoin. It is a viral technology that does not stop. El Salvador has taken the bold step of adopting Bitcoin in full, declaring it as a legal tender and using the Lightning Network for daily use. However, each country reacts differently to this technology. Some have banned it and criminalized its use, adding to the complexity of Bitcoin adoption based on cultures, eras, and nations.

The rise of Bitcoin forces companies, universities, regulators, and individuals to take this new technology into account. New tools must be created, services must be adapted, and innovation must continue to ensure their survival. This context raises many questions touching on various fields, including cryptography, game theory, economics and finance, computer science, philosophy, laws, and regulation.

I invite you to reflect on this new monetary revolution. There is so much to explore with Bitcoin that it is complicated to assimilate everything at once. Take your time, Bitcoin is not going to disappear. On the contrary, the revolution has just begun.
Together, I believe we are capable of creating the world we want to entrust to our children. A world where human sovereignty is a right, where privacy is respected by default, and where currency is not manipulated. I hope that together we can achieve this.

If you want to develop your knowledge of Bitcoin, many authors, thinkers, and essayists have contributed to the educational layer of Bitcoin. For the past few years, I have been compiling and categorizing these works to offer a library of resources to the most curious among you. You will find the best podcasts, websites, articles, tutorials, books, Twitter posts, and other content.

Renowned economist Milton Friedman predicted in 1999: "I think that the Internet is going to be one of the major forces for reducing the role of government. The one thing that's missing, but that will soon be developed, is a reliable e-cash - a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A." Today, Bitcoin fulfills this prediction.

# The Lightning Network

## Introduction to the Lightning Network

![The Lightning Network](https://youtu.be/HFv3NN4z450)

The Lightning Network is a revolutionary technology that has profoundly changed our perception of Bitcoin. It is a solution that addresses the scalability issue of Bitcoin.
To fully understand the Lightning Network, it is crucial to understand how Bitcoin evolves. Bitcoin develops in infrastructure layers: the first layer is the blockchain, and the second layer is the Lightning Network.

Recognized as a layer of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network has been validated and adopted on a large scale since 2021. It allows for instant microtransactions at low cost, thus solving the scalability problem of Bitcoin.
The Lightning Network works through liquidity channels. Liquidity is transmitted from right to left and vice versa as needed. Transactions are locked via a system of multiple signatures (multisig) and are governed by new rules, laws, forms, and flexibilities.

The Lightning Network acts as a network of payment channels, allowing for instant and feeless transactions between the two parties. This network of payment channels makes it possible for transactions between individuals who do not have a directly connected channel.
Users of the Lightning Network can pay channel opening fees to create a multisig smart contract. There are no transaction fees between directly connected users, but fees are paid to Lightning routing nodes (hubs) for transactions between non-connected users. Traditional money transfer services such as Western Union, central banks, Visa, and Mastercard could disappear if they do not adopt Lightning Network technology. The Lightning Network is more efficient, cheaper, and more ethical than the traditional financial system.

Indeed, the Lightning Network allows for millions and billions of transactions between two connected people without fees and without energy expenses on the base blockchain. Transactions are secured by cryptographic technology and indirectly by miner energy and the base blockchain. Transactions can be made instantly, without geographic limits, and fees are extremely low.

El Salvador is an example of a country mainly using the Lightning Network. Startups like Strike take advantage of this technology to send euros and dollars in a second and without fees.

The Lightning Network is the future of Bitcoin. Engineering choices for Bitcoin are carefully considered, treating Bitcoin as nuclear or space code. The loss of Bitcoin would be a loss of financial liberation opportunity.

The Lightning Network is a new infrastructure layer to solve the problem of Bitcoin scalability. It allows for millions and billions of transactions between two connected people without fees and without energy expenses on the base blockchain. It is essential to stay informed about this technology to understand the future of Bitcoin and finance in general.

![the lightning network](assets/posters/en/20._lightning_network.png)

## Use cases of the Lightning Network

![LN use cases](https://youtu.be/_UV2jmQ8TQM)

The Bitcoin protocol, while revolutionary, has faced significant challenges in scalability and transaction efficiency. To address these issues, a second-layer solution known as the Lightning Network has been proposed and implemented. This technology aims to facilitate micro-transactions, i.e., transactions of very low value, which would otherwise be impractical due to high fees and long confirmation times on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The Lightning Network works by creating off-chain payment channels between parties who wish to make frequent transactions. These channels allow for near-instant transactions and minimal fees, making micro-transactions viable.
This technology opens the door to a wide range of potential applications for Bitcoin, which were previously out of reach due to inherent limitations in blockchain technology. Among these applications are routing nodes for network efficiency, money streaming for real-time payments, messaging for secure and decentralized communications, and futuristic business models that were previously unimaginable.

The video game industry offers a particularly interesting example of how the Lightning Network can be used to transform existing business models. The concept of "skin in the game" is an idea that has recently gained popularity in this context. Essentially, it involves having a financial stake in the outcome of a game.

The Lightning Network allows players to wager very small amounts of money when playing games, such as 0.001 cents. This leads to monetary video game systems, where competition is not only for the fun of the game, but also for real financial gain.

Games can be priced, with entry fees ranging from 1 cent to 10 euros. This adds a competitive element that makes the game more interesting and engaging. Additionally, companies can sponsor games for small amounts, creating new opportunities for players in regions like Africa, where potential gain can have a significant impact.

In summary, the future of micro-transactions with Bitcoin looks promising thanks to innovations like the Lightning Network. As these technologies continue to develop and mature, we can expect to see new and exciting applications emerge in the near future.

The concept of "money streaming" is a vision for the future that is made possible by the Lightning Network. This network allows for instant micro-transactions, paving the way for economic models where consumers pay by the second for the content they consume.

In such a system, money is automatically divided, based on a predetermined percentage, among the various contributors to a service or product. This could revolutionize the way we think about payment models. For example, instead of paying a monthly subscription for a service, users could be charged by the second for the time they spend using the service.

This economic model could have profound implications for content creators, who would be incentivized to produce quality content to retain users' attention. Users, in turn, would only pay for the content they consume, eliminating upfront subscription fees. It is even conceivable to use this system to pay for services such as overtaking a car on the road.
Although this system may seem unfair to some, it is important to consider the benefits. The micro-transactions made possible by Bitcoin allow for instant payments without intermediaries. Thus, cars could potentially make payments to each other to facilitate overtaking, thanks to the use of a programmable currency.

In conclusion, the Lightning Network opens up a multitude of exciting use cases for Bitcoin users. The resulting economic models and business opportunities are numerous and varied.

## Red pill or blue pill?

![red pill](https://youtu.be/nCRVIoyyyck)

As Morpheus said to Neo: Choose the blue pill to stop, the red pill to go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole.

### Technological future and its implications

Technology is evolving exponentially and no one can predict its future with certainty. Connectivity and artificial intelligence will be increasingly developed. The knowledge gained through the internet is also exponential.
AI has already surpassed humans in video games, board games, film, text, and music creation. This means that 80% of jobs will disappear due to AI and automation. We therefore have two options for the future: to restrict evolution or to harvest the increase in capital created by AI and redistribute it to the population.

The essential questions to ask are: how to manage a society where 80% of jobs will disappear? How to revitalize a population? Is there a need for so many teachers? The geopolitical, political, and human consequences of automation are not sufficiently discussed. Computing, the internet, streaming, and VR will change education. We could have a universal course for all French students managed by the government and teachers who no longer give the course but accompany the students. Children could go into a virtual world and be accompanied to learn history. Where is the limit between a teacher and an AI? How to guarantee a society that lives in prosperity? The fundamental questions for our future are not being debated.

### What future for finance?

There are also questions about who should hold, authorize, and track money. The goal is to decide between a closed system with guardians or an open system without guardians. Is currency a form of private property? Can protesters' accounts be blocked without a Supreme Court order? Does private property allow the state and banks to steal our money without judicial intervention? Who guarantees the financial system? How can an individual be sovereign over their money and be a trusted third party? Can money be sent to the other side of the world without fees or intermediaries? Accepting this technology could generate massive economies of scale for the poorest. Should the free flow of capital be allowed? International blockades have economic and political consequences. Is it ethical to use financial intermediaries like Western Union that charge 25% fees? In a digital world, money should be democratized and considered a common good belonging to the people rather than the state.

The question of who should control the banking system is crucial because the rules of the banking game are not transparent and understandable to all, allowing a caste of politicians and regulators to maintain their grip on the system. It is important to ask whether the free market or a group of intellectuals should control the banking system.

Censorship must be questioned because who has the knowledge to decide what should be censored or not? The media has changed its position on certain information (e.g. transmission of the virus) and people who were censored before are no longer censored today. Who decides what is censorship or propaganda? Who has the divine hand on our system? Tolerating censorship can destroy freedom of expression and the right to assemble. Implementing censorship is technically difficult without creating a complete dystopia. Which entity should have the power of censorship? The question of censorship is complicated and it is difficult to know who should be censored or not. Censorship can have a negative impact on innovation and freedom to undertake. Religion is an example of censorship that has had negative consequences in history.
There are 2.4 billion people in the world without a bank account, which creates inequalities. Bitcoin allows for equality in transactions, regardless of one's social status or political position. The Bitcoin protocol is apolitical and does not give specific privileges to the president or other actors. Leaders should have the same privileges as ordinary people to push development upwards rather than leaving some at the top and others at the bottom. Should everyone have the same currency, regardless of their social status? It is important to think about the world we want to leave to our children, an open world where they are free to do what they want with their money.

Bitcoin is important and should not be considered just a game of money. It is crucial to ask questions about Bitcoin now.

![red pill](assets/posters/en/2._oprange_pill.png)

# Bitcoin: A Revolutionary Protocol

![Conclusion](https://youtu.be/BoZL_D7uLAg)

The Bitcoin protocol is apolitical, allowing all transactions to be recorded in a database, the blockchain, which guarantees monetary truth. The infrastructure layers of level 2 and 3 allow the network to evolve and develop new features.

Bitcoin is designed like nuclear or space engineering, evolving slowly and deliberately to reach a critical mass of 7 billion people and not break the network. Bitcoin has all the necessary characteristics to be a currency: divisible, instantly transportable, uncensorable, easily movable, and ideal for storing value over time. Bitcoin is pseudonymous and can be exchanged anywhere in the world without permission.

Bitcoin has been adopted by different groups of people, from libertarian geeks to traditional businesses. Bitcoin is used by a very large part of the population, with over 100 million users. Bitcoin cannot be stopped or censored anymore. It is a peaceful revolution to change our monetary system and allow inclusivity.

Users can obtain Bitcoins by accepting them for their trade or by buying them through regulated or unregulated platforms. Bitcoins can be stored in wallets, mobile applications, or physical devices. No trusted intermediary in Bitcoin. Bitcoin advocates freedom and an exit from the traditional system.

Changing the system requires changing the currency. The decoupling between gold, resources, silver, and the real world creates inequalities in society. Satoshi created Bitcoin in 2008 to address this situation. Absolute money also corrupts. A complete monetary reset is necessary to address certain societal problems.

Bitcoin allows for the emancipation of the banking system and more equality. It is a social phenomenon and leads to a peaceful revolution.
