## information to know before starting

In order to acquire exposure to Bitcoin, you first need to obtain some. While the best method is to earn it through your time and effort, buying it is also a commonly used solution. To facilitate the trade between sellers and buyers, there are services available that act as intermediaries.

In this section, we will explore all the possible solutions that cater to this need. They are mainly divided into two categories: centralized exchanges, which are usually regulated and require ID verification (KYC), and peer-to-peer exchanges that do not.

The line between the types of KYC requirements is often blurred, as different jurisdictions may have varying requirements. Each tutorial will therefore be categorized based on its level of KYC and centralization.

When using an exchange, it's important to understand the trade-offs involved, such as privacy, ease of use, liquidity needs, functionality, and cost.

If you need extra help in making a decision, please refer to our BTC 101 formation for beginners or BTC 205 for advanced non-KYC solutions.

As a rule of thumb:

    KYC is considered unfavorable.
    Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) is a good strategy.
    Automatically withdrawing funds to your wallet is beneficial.
    Peer-to-peer exchanges are highly recommended.
