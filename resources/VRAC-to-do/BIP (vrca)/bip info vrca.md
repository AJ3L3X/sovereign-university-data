BIP-11		https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0011.mediawiki	"BIP 11 is all about making Bitcoin more secure and flexible. It introduces something called ""M-of-N Standard Transactions."" This might sound complicated, but it just means that you need more than one person (or computer) to agree before you can spend certain bitcoins. This can help keep your bitcoins safe and can also be used for other things like making deals where multiple people need to agree.

Imagine you have a piggy bank, but instead of just having one lock, it has several locks. You need a certain number of keys to open those locks before you can get your money. That's kind of how M-of-N transactions work.

Here are a couple of examples of how this might be useful:

    Imagine you have a wallet, and you want to make it extra secure. You can set it up so that you need two keys (signatures) to spend your bitcoins. One key is held by you, and the other key is held by your dad. This means that even if someone gets hold of your key, they still can't spend your bitcoins without the second key from your dad.

    Let's say you want to buy something from someone online, but you don't completely trust them. You can use a 2-of-3 transaction, where you, the seller, and a trusted third party (like a referee) each have a key. To complete the transaction, two of the three keys are needed. This way, if there's a disagreement, the trusted third party can help decide what happens to the bitcoins.

BIP 11 is just a way to make Bitcoin more secure and versatile by adding the option to use multiple signatures for certain transactions. It's like having extra locks on your piggy bank to keep your money safe and make sure everyone agrees before it's spent."	This BIP proposes M-of-N-signatures required transactions as a new 'standard' transaction type.	Gavin Andresen
