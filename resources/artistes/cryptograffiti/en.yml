I am a Bitcoin activist artist.  My work is dedicated to spreading a grass roots movement with the ability to change the world for the better.  

I see Bitcoin as a necessary alternative to our broken financial system.  Beyond finance, I believe separating money from state is one of the most crucial steps we can take for humanity in an increasingly Orwellian society.

Art has the ability to distill complex subject matter into something more people can understand.  This is especially important with Bitcoin as those who stand to benefit from it the most are likely to learn about it the latest. 

By repurposing banking materials in my work, I hope to teach others about the importance of this movement vs the status quo.
