  American Kingpin, by Nick Bilton is a gripping true crime story about Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the Silk Road, an online black market that traded illegal drugs, weapons, and other goods using Bitcoin as the payment method. The book delves into the rise and fall of Ulbricht, who operated under the pseudonym "Dread Pirate Roberts," and the law enforcement officials who brought him down. It explores the technical and legal challenges of tracking down an anonymous criminal on the dark web, and raises important questions about the role of technology in enabling illicit activities.
