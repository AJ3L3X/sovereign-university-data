question: What is the risk of using a level 4 wallet?

wrong_answers:
  - Each part of the multisig should be stored in the same location
  - Each part of the multisig should be stored in a digital location
  - Each part of the multisig should be stored in a physical location
explanation: >-
  When you use a level 4 wallet, each part of the multisig should be stored
  in different locations. This is because the multisig requires multiple signatures
  to perform a transaction, and storing each part in a different location adds an
  extra layer of security.
